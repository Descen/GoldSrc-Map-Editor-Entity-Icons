This pack is tested with JACK

(Works with Hammer Editor and Sven Craft too.)

## About this pack

Originally made it for my personal usage, but some other people might find this usefull too.
It gives most of the Sven Co-op point enitites colorcoded model/sprites representatives.

The current upload is Sven Co-op specific, but with editing any goldsrc game FGD and adding their
own game specific entity icons should make it work with that game.

## Installation 

#### **For Half-life:**
