This pack is tested with JACK

(Works with Hammer Editor(v3.5) and Sven Craft too.)

## About this pack

Originally made it for my personal usage, but some other people might find this usefull too.
It gives most of the point enitites colorcoded model/sprites representatives.

~~The current upload is Sven Co-op specific, but with editing any goldsrc game FGD and adding their
own game specific entity icons should make it work with that game.~~

## Installation 

#### **For Half-life:** 
Copy the pack into your "../Half-Life/" folder.

#### **For Sven Co-op:** 
Copy the pack into your "../Sven Co-op/" folder.
