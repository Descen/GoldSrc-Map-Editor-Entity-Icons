This pack is tested with JACK
Works with Hammer Editor and Sven Craft too.

**About this pack**

Originally made it for my personal usage, but some other people might find this usefull too.
It gives most of the Sven Co-op point enitites colorcoded model/sprites representatives.

The current upload is Sven Co-op specific, but with editing any goldsrc game FGD and adding their
own game specific entity icons could make it work with that game.

**Installation**

Copy the pack into your "../Sven Co-op/" folder.
